# Simple
Encrypt by sharing a simple password only.

This is a good way to try out &appname;, but it's possibly not very secure: An attacker can simply try out / guess the password, so make sure you use a very long and complicated password.

###Adding Passwords
To encrypt or decrypt, you will first have to add another password by tapping "Add Password". &appname; will keep and remember a password until the time you specify when entering the password.

Once a password has expired, it is completely gone. You will have to enter it again on this page!

###Selecting Passwords
To encrypt with one or multiple passwords, simply tap on the checkbox next to each password. &appname; will encrypt the message for each of the selected passwords - anybody who knows at least one of the selected passwords will be able to decrypt the message.
