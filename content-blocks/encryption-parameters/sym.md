#Symmetric
Encrypt by sharing a secure symmetric key

This is a very safe way to encrypt, but you will have to share the encryption key through a safe channel - ideally by meeting in person and â€¦[sharing the symmetric key via Camera and QR-Code](/encryption-parameters/symmetric-keys/key-create).

###Adding keys
Please use the main &appname; app to [create and organize your symmetric keys](/encryption-parameters/symmetric-keys).

###Selecting Keys
To encrypt with one or multiple keys, simply tap on the checkbox next to each key. &appname; will encrypt the message for each of the selected keys - anybody who has at least one of the selected keys will be able to decrypt the message.
