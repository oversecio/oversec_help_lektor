title: Panic
---
body:

Activating Panic-Mode will *immediately*

* forget all entered passwords for "simple" encryption
* close all unlocked symmetric keys 
* close all cached keys in OpenKeyChain
* remove all &appname; overlays, buttons and notifications.
* force-stop &appname;

so that no indication of anything "secret" will be left on the device (Of course an investigator will still see that the &appname; app is installed on the device)

Panic-Mode can be activated by

* Long-tapping the [Hide Button](/buttons#button_hide)
* Tapping "STOP" in the &appname; notification

To re-enable &appname; after Panic-Mode has been entered, go to the main &appname; app and tap on "Reactivate"
