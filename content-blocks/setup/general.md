### General Settings

####Panic when screen off
Enter panic mode when screen turns off. Enable this if you want to enter Panic Mode every time the phone screen turns off. You will have to dial a secrete code in the dialer to reactivate &appname;. Use this to make you phone look inconspicuous every tine youturn on the screen.

####Hide launcher icon in Panic Mode
Enable this to hide the &appname; launcher icon while in panic mode. You will have to dial a secrete code in the dialer to reactivate &appname; and unhide the launcher icon.

####Secret Dialer Code
Configure the code to dial (in the dialer app) to reactivate &appname; (exit panic mode)

####Allow Screenshots
By default, &appname; prevents the system from taking screenshots while showing sensitive information. Depending on the way the screenshots are made, taking screenshots either fails or produces a blank or black image.

You can disable this behavior temporarily if you want to take screenshots to show or tell about &appname;, but we strongly recommend to keep this setting OFF!
