### General Settings

####Allow Screenshots
By default, Oversec prevents the system from taking screenshots while showing sensitive information. Depending on the way the screenshots are made, taking screenshots either fails or produces a blank or black image.

You can disable this behavior temporarily if you want to take screenshots to show or tell about Oversec, but we strongly recommend to keep this setting OFF! 

####Panic when screen off
Enter panic mode when screen turns off. Enable this if you want to enter Panic Mode every time the phone screen turns off. You will have to dial a secrete code in the dialer to reactivate Oversec. Use this to make you phone look inconspicuous every tine youturn on the screen.

####Hide launcher icon in Panic Mode
Enable this to hide the Oversec launcher icon while in panic mode. You will have to dial a secrete code in the dialer to reactivate Oversec and unhide the launcher icon.

####Secret Dialer Code
Configure the code to dial (in the dialer app) to reactivate Oversec (exit panic mode)
