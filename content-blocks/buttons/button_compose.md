### Compose-Button
<div class="buttoncircle"><img src="ic_create_black_24dp.png"></img></div>


This button lets you enter text in a separate screen and then place the encrypted text into the clipboard.
You can then paste the text from the clipboard into input fields that are otherwise not accessible by Oversec.
(Example: Body of an email message in "Inbox by Gmail")
Tap this button to open the input screen. 

<a name="compose_encrypt_button"></a>
After you have entered the text, tap the button in this screen. The entered text gets encrypted and is placed into the clipboard,

<a name="paste_clipboard"></a>
Now long-tap on an input field and then select "PASTE" to paste the encrypted text from the clipboard into the input field.

*Note: This button can be dragged and placed anywhere on the screen.*

*Note: This button is not enabled by default. Click the config button to open the [per-app configuration page](/setup/per-app-config/) where you can enable the compose button.*
