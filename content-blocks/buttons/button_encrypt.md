### Encrypt-Button
<div class="buttoncircle"><img src="/buttons/ic_lock_black_24dp.png"></img></div>

<a name="button_encrypt_initial"></a>
Tap this button to encrypt the entered text. After the text has been encrypted, this button automatically disappears. So if you place this button over the underlying app's "send" or "save" button, you can make sure that you do not accidentally send or save plain text.

If you have not encrypted anything yet in this app, tapping this button will bring up a screen to enter or modify the encryption params. Next time you tap this button, those params will be used and the encryption will happen instantly. 
If you still want to change the encryption params, long-tap on this button to forcefully bring up the encryption-params screen.

*Hint: Double-tapping this button will hide it for a short time, so that the underlying app's buttons can be tapped.
So if the Encrypt-Button is positioned right above the underlying app's send button, you can _triple_ tap at this position to send an _unencrypted_ message!* 

*Note: This button can be dragged and placed around the input field.*
