body:

Oversec can not directly enter text into a note, because Evernote uses a "WebView" component for that. 
A note can be encrypted via the [compose button](/buttons/#button_compose)

Invisible encoding is not supported in Evernote, please use Base64 or Ascii-Armored PGP instead.

On Android 4.x, it is not possible to display/decrypt encrypted mails. However, you can still use the GMail app to compose and send encrypted mails.
