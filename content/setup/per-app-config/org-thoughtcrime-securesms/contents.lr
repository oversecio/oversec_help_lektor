### Version 3.16.0

Signal somehow truncates messages that are longer than a certain size,
Therefore, PGP encryption (with invisible encoding) will not work with signal.
You may however use symmetric encryption which should still work (messages using symmetric encryption are much smaller than PGP encrypted messages)
