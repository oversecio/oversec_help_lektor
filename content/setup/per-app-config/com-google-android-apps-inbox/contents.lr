body:

Oversec can not directly enter text into the body of an email. 
The body of an email can be encrypted via the [compose button](/buttons/#button_compose)

Invisible encoding is not supported in emails, please use Base64 or Ascii-Armored PGP instead.

On Android 4.x, it is not possible to display/decrypt encrypted mails. However, you can still use the GMail app to compose and send encrypted mails.
