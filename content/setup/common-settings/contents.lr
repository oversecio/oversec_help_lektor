### Allow Screenshot
By default, Oversec will prevent taking screenshots while possible de-crypted text or plain keys are shown on the screen.

An attempt to do such screenshot will either fail or produce a blank / black image.

If you need to do screenshots to blog or write an article about how great Oversec is, you can check the box here to allow screenshots - just don't forget to uncheck once you're done.
