####Allow Screenshots
By default, Oversec prevents the system from taking screenshots while showing sensitive information. Depending on the way the screenshots are made, taking screenshots either fails or produces a blank or black image.

You can disable this behavior temporarily if you want to take screenshots to show or tell about Oversec, but we strongly recommend to keep this setting OFF!
